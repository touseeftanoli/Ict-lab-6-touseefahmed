Git is a distributed version control system that enables developers to track changes in source code, manage revisions, and collaborate efficiently. It provides mechanisms for branching, merging, and maintaining a complete history of a project on each developer’s local machine, which improves reliability, performance, and parallel development workflows.
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting platform built around Git. It provides remote repositories, collaboration features (such as pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking), and integrations with CI/CD and project-management tools. GitHub extends Git’s core capabilities by enabling teams to coordinate development, automate workflows, and manage open-source or private projects centrally.
